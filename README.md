# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game (Python Mini Project)

A fun and interactive command-line game where the player guesses a randomly selected number between 1 and 100. This mini-project demonstrates foundational Python concepts like input handling, loops, functions, exception handling, and clean code practices.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goal

To build a beginner-friendly CLI game that:
- Generates a random number
- Prompts the user to guess the number
- Gives helpful feedback (Too high / Too low)
- Tracks the number of attempts
- Handles invalid input gracefully

---

## ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Random number generation  
âœ… Input validation & exception handling  
âœ… Modular and clean code structure  
âœ… Range checking with user-friendly feedback  
âœ… Uses constants and helper functions  
âœ… Emoji-enhanced console interaction ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ§  Skills Practiced

- Python basics (`input()`, `print()`, `int()`, etc.)
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Exception handling (`try-except`)
- Function design and modular thinking
- Code readability and naming conventions
- Using `__name__ == "__main__"` to organize scripts
